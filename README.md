## Benefits

* **You can add whitespaces**

  This allows you to organize with spaces,
  new lines and indentation.

* **You can add comments**
 
  When a pice of code is not self-explanatory, a good comment
  makes a huge difference.

* **You are using words**

  The words that describe the regular expression, are significantly
  more readable. It is easier to memorize words which means
  something than some arbitrarily selected special characters.

* **Maintenance is simpler**

  If you want to make a change in a well structured code, you simply
  do it. With regular expression, you have to parse it your head,
  track brackets, groups, and divide it into pieces.

* **Code review is faster and more accurate**

  It easier to understand well formatted verbose code and changes
  that are happening there. Have you ever try to review changes
  in regular expression that are longer than 100 characters?
  What was the felling?

* **You can reuse code**

  You can put pieces of your expression into variables and simply
  insert them into you expression. This is like dividing your
  code into functions.

* **You can forget about double meaning**

  Some flags are automatically taken care. For example, you
  don't need to think if dot character includes new lines or not.

* **You are using sain language**

  Long regular expressions looks like those esoteric programming
  languages created just to give you a headache when trying to
  use them.
